This one's been tough. I've been working on this project for a week and a couple days and I still have a few bugs I need to fix. 

I made a simple flashcard application so that users can create a topic, and then create flashcards that belong to that topic. Everything was going smoothly until I tried to give some CRUD funcitonalities to my flashcards. I decided I wanted to have my topics controller include all of the relationships so that when I used fetch I would just have to go through that controller. It was straight forward to get the flashcards, but once I tried to implement edit and delete functionalities for my flashcards, I started running into problems. I guess the positive that came out of this experience is that I realized the importance of the separation of concerns principle.
