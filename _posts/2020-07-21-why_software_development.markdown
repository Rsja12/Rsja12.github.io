I was never the guy that other people came to for tech advice. Before I started to learn how to code last year, I was a carpenter and barely knew anything related to computers. However, the older I got, the more curious and intrigued I became by them because of how important they are in today's society.

What I enjoyed the most from working as a carpenter was the gratifying feeling I got from seeing a project at the end. The process of taking raw materials and turning them into a finished product, like someone's dream kitchen, is an amazing feeling. The reason I decided I wanted to learn more about technology and software development was because I started to feel like I was being left behind in today's world. I wanted to understand how these new tools worked and why they were so important.

I had no clue that coding bootcamps were a thing, and when I first came across one online I thought it was a scam. I came across other sites like freeCodeCamp and codecademy where I could very quickly write out a hello world in html and that got me hooked. Every night after work I would keep learning about html and css little by little. Then I started to see just how powerful things could become when I got to JavaScript. The whole time, I kept wondering if that bootcamp I had come across was actually something real. I wish I had done more research on them before I did because I spent a couple of months telling myself that it was too good to be true and that it had to be a scam. One day I decided to reach out to a friend who I knew 'did something with computers' for work if he knew anything about bootcamps. I was surprised when he told me his brother in law had recently got his first developer job after going through a bootcamp. Hearing this made me feel very hopeful for what my future could be. 

I decided to stop working and focus full time on learning how to code. I began to research different bootcamps and decided that Flatiron would be the best choice for me. A month later I was starting the first day of the software development program. 

What I enjoy the most about coding, is that I get that exact same gratifying feeling I got when doing a woodworking project. The difference is that instead of a hammer, I now use a keyboard to create something useful for other people.
