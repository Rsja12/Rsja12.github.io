After three weeks of the Software Engineering program it was time to begin our first major project. I read through the instructions a few times and with excitement opened up my text editor. The blank page waited for me to write the first lines of code while I thought to myself, "well f--k, I have no clue where to begin." 

The purpose of this project was to build a CLI data gem that scraped information from a website for us to provide to the user. We then had to give the user the option to go one level deep and provide even more information based on the input the user gave. Learning to use Nokogiri to scrape from websites is awesome and frustrating at the same time. Once you find a website that you want to use, and that you can scrape, the fun begins. In my case, it was necessary to do extensive surgery on data in order to get rid of the information that wasn't needed. It felt pretty great to take a long string that contained the data that I needed and use everything I had learned in the last few weeks to manipulate that data, and slowly but surely turn it into the array that I needed for my app to work. 

Talking with other people from my cohort we realized that we were all trying to jump over similar obstacles. Pair programming became an all day thing as we looked through code and helped each other see things in a completely different way. 

The feeling I got after finally getting my app to work was the best. I'm looking forward to keep practicing what I've learned so far, and to learn new concepts.
